#ARRAY:
#Array is defined as a collection of elements of same data type.
#Hence, it is also called as homogeneous collection of data items.

#Algorithm to computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log :
#1. Start
#2. Read type of transaction and amount.
#3. If it deposit type of transaction then add it in balance
#4. Else if it is withdrawal operation then decrease balance
#5. Display total balance
#6. Stop.
