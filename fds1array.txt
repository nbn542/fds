#Array is defined as a collection of elements of same data type.
#Algorithm to accept 10 student’s marks:
#1. Start
#2. Read the marks of 10 students and stored in array (-1 for absent student)
#3. Calculate and print the average of 10 student’s marks
#4. Comparing all student’s marks print highest marks
#5. Comparing all student’s marks print lowest marks
#6. Comparing all student’s marks print mark scored by most of the students
#7. Comparing -1 in an array, print absent students
#8. Stop
